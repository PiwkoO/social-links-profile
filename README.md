## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I learned that even though something looks different in designs you cannot make it exactly the same on the website. I double-checked things to be pixel perfect and still I found a few things that should look like different. Well, there is beauty in it as well I guess... 

### Continued development

In the future would like to add more logic to this project and maybe get a user from database. I'll see how it's going to be.
